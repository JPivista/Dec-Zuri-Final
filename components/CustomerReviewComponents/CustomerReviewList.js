My stay this time from 16th to 19th October 2017 was exceptional. I would like to appreciate the efforts of Mr. Tridip who was very kind in making all the arrangements, Mr. Conney in charge of the travel, Mr. Allwyn and Mr. Saby for driving me and my family around, Miss Leena at the front desk and the staff at Zuri for making it a very comfortable and relaxing stay. I WOULD REALLY RECEMOND GUESTS TO STAY AT THE ZURI WHITE SANDS GOA as you are take care of right from the point of arrival till you depart. ",

        "description": "What a fantastic stay (1st Dec - 15th Dec 2017) we had - the staff could not have been more helpful and friendly - food very reasonable not at all what was expected - the free form pool was great and the grounds manicured. The beautiful beach was only a 3 to 4 minute stroll from the Hotel and when we got there virtually deserted apart from the odd cow. All the trips we made were organized by the hotel and all went with out a hitch with plenty to do in and around the area - this was possibly the best holiday we have enjoyed and we will without doubt return for round two.",
